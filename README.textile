CoffeeScript/JavaScript online/offline data store.

This library acts as a container for a collection of arbitrary objects, providing persistence using RESTful JSON web services and HTML5 offline storage. It will house a collection of objects, add/delete objects, track changes, and synchronize said changes back to the server. It's ideal for environments where a stable connection can't be guaranteed, and data (as well as modifications) need to be cached and synchronized in batch.

Read-only apps need not specify all URLs; a list-only map will suffice.
